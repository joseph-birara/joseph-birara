# Joseph Birara

Backend engineer focused on building reliable production systems, APIs, and integrations.

I work primarily with Go, Node.js, and Python, designing services that handle real users, real transactions, and real operational constraints. My background includes fintech infrastructure, search and recommendation systems, and LLM driven automation.

I am comfortable owning services end to end, from design and implementation to deployment, monitoring, and incident resolution.
